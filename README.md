project progress of swe 573 course in the year 2022 spring.
## installing django
I tried to install django. It seems simple, but unexpected errors suprised me. I have a new mac computer with m1 processor. I thought while I was purchasing the m1 computer that all the compatible software will be available in a few months. Unfortunately, it is not.
When I run the command to install posgresql 
sudo apt install python3-dev libpq-dev
chain of errors poped-up.
